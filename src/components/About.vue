          Established in 2014, DOT is the Design club of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara.<br>
          Dots are the most basic part of any creative style. If a person understands the way to connect the dots, designing becomes easier to interpret and imagine. The nine dots of the logo represent the same. All the alphabets can be written connecting the nine dots.
          We as a team believe in working together and helping others to learn and grow. From designing for a fest to working for GDG, we have come a long way through and we try to raise the bar of our standards with each and every project.
